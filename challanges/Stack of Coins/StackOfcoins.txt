You are given an array representing N stacks of coins, numbered from 0 to Nâˆ’1. In one move we can pick two coins from 
any stack we choose, discard the first coin and move the second coin to an adjacant stack.

Write a function that, given an array A of N integers, recording the heights of the stacks,
returns the maximum number of coins that can be accumulated in 
one stack after performing any number of moves as described above.
