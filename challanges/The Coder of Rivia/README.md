You are given a 3x3 matrix: [a1, a2, a3, a4, a5, a6, a7, a8, a9].
In one move you can increment any element by 1.
Your task is to find a matrix whose elements in each row and each column sum to an equal value,
which can be constructed from the given matrix in a minimal number of moves.

For example:

SPOILER:

Time complexity: O(1)
