The problem:
A rectangular map consisting of N rows and M columns of square areas is given. Each area is painted with a certain color.
Two areas on the map belong to the same country if both coditions are met:
1. they have the same color.
2. you can move from one to another by going west/south/north/east (meaning, not diagonally).

Write a function that counts the number of countries.

For example:



Time complexity O(N*M)

Side note: my first given solution used recursion. I added it as it is much more intuitive. However, when the given matrix is large
the depth of the program's stack is too large. 
Thus, my other and correct solution does not use recursion, but uses a stack to keep track of the relevant borders.
Each time a cell is popped out of the stack, we add its neighbors if they have the same color.
