You are given N counters, initially set to 0, and you have two possible operations on them:
increase(X) − counter X is increased by 1,
max counter − all counters are set to the maximum value of any counter.

A non-empty array A of M integers is given. This array represents consecutive operations:
if A[K] = X, such that 1 ≤ X ≤ N, then operation K is increase(X),
if A[K] = N + 1 then operation K is max counter.

The goal is to calculate the value of every counter after all operations.
